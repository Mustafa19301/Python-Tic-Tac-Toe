Welcome to my Fun Python Project: Tic-Tac-Toe

Essentaily its a Python code where you can play Tic-Tac_toe virtually using the terminal. Players are listed as X and O (2-player game).

This Python code makes use of dictionary for the borad style and also the use of definition to simply organize each place in the code. Run the program and let me know on your thoughts about this :)

Appreciate your FeedBack. Mustafa Ahmed.
