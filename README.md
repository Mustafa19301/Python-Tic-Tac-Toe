Welcome to my Fun Python Project: Tic-Tac-Toe

Essentaily its a Python code where you can play Tic-Tac-toe virtually using the terminal. Players are listed as X and O (2-player game).

Game is played like this:
7|8|9
4|5|6
1|2|3

The number is what you will type from the keyboard so X or O will be registered.

This Python code makes use of dictionary for the borad style and also the use of definition to simply organize each place in the code. Run the program and let me know on your thoughts about this :)

Appreciate your FeedBack. Mustafa Ahmed.
